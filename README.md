Mandala Computing Test Environment

## ✨ Purpose

Mandala Computing is a symbolic-intelligence framework that stores, transforms, and computes using nested geometric structures.

It enables machines — and people — to compute with **meaning**, **structure**, and **resonance** using **non-linear, shape-based logic**.

Fractal-Geometric Computational Simulation

Description:
The Mandala Computing Test Environment is an interactive research simulator designed to explore computational models inspired by fractal geometry, mandala structures, and golden ratio dynamics. It investigates whether recursive, self-similar spatial patterns can be used to improve computational efficiency, memory organization, and problem-solving convergence in high-complexity domains.

Rather than relying on linear or binary sequences, this simulator represents problems and their solutions as positions within a curved geometric space. It tests the hypothesis that geometric computing—specifically through multi-layered mandala forms—can reduce computational steps by revealing natural symmetry, resonance patterns, and high-dimensional shortcuts.

Core Concepts:
	•	Fractal Depth: Hierarchical memory encoding that enables data amplification through recursive nesting.
	•	Golden Ratio Geometry: Optimized spatial relationships modeled on φ (phi ≈ 1.618) to simulate organic efficiency.
	•	Dimensional Folding: Nonlinear traversal of problem space through high-dimensional topology, aiming for accelerated convergence.
	•	Geometric Complexity Navigation: Mapping of hard problems (e.g., factoring, P vs NP) as geometric states within nested architectures.

Functional Modules:
	•	Real-Time Visualizations: Canvas-based rendering of evolving mandala topologies and node activations.
	•	Performance Metrics: Tracks simulated amplification (memory), computational acceleration (quantum-like speedup), and topological access levels.
	•	Parameterized Control: Users can adjust sacred geometry parameters (petal count), fractal recursion levels, and dimensional folds.
	•	Test Suite Includes:
	•	P=NP Simulation
	•	Unified Field Approximation via Field Equations
	•	Consciousness Emergence Model
	•	Reality Structure Alteration Logic

Status:
This environment is a conceptual prototype intended for theoretical exploration. It does not perform real computation on input problems but models and visualizes the potential of a fractal-geometric computing architecture.

Clarification on P vs NP and Related Models

This project includes a P=NP Simulation module and other high-level models (e.g., unified field approximation, consciousness emergence) strictly as conceptual experiments within a symbolic-geometric framework.

It does not present a formal proof, refutation, or computational solution to these problems as they are defined in classical mathematics or computer science. Instead, the simulator explores how such challenges might be reframed or made irrelevant in a nonlinear, fractal-mandala paradigm where computation is expressed spatially rather than linearly.

The intention is exploratory and architectural, not adversarial to established domains. Readers should interpret these modules as thought experiments and visualizations rather than conventional proofs or algorithms.


Intended Audience:
Researchers in unconventional computation, AI emergence, quantum simulation, complexity theory, or those exploring biologically-inspired or geometrically-rooted architectures for future computing systems.
