Mandala Computing Test Environment

Fractal-Geometric Computational Simulation

Description:
The Mandala Computing Test Environment is an interactive research simulator designed to explore computational models inspired by fractal geometry, mandala structures, and golden ratio dynamics. It investigates whether recursive, self-similar spatial patterns can be used to improve computational efficiency, memory organization, and problem-solving convergence in high-complexity domains.

Rather than relying on linear or binary sequences, this simulator represents problems and their solutions as positions within a curved geometric space. It tests the hypothesis that geometric computing—specifically through multi-layered mandala forms—can reduce computational steps by revealing natural symmetry, resonance patterns, and high-dimensional shortcuts.

Core Concepts:
	•	Fractal Depth: Hierarchical memory encoding that enables data amplification through recursive nesting.
	•	Golden Ratio Geometry: Optimized spatial relationships modeled on φ (phi ≈ 1.618) to simulate organic efficiency.
	•	Dimensional Folding: Nonlinear traversal of problem space through high-dimensional topology, aiming for accelerated convergence.
	•	Geometric Complexity Navigation: Mapping of hard problems (e.g., factoring, P vs NP) as geometric states within nested architectures.

Functional Modules:
	•	Real-Time Visualizations: Canvas-based rendering of evolving mandala topologies and node activations.
	•	Performance Metrics: Tracks simulated amplification (memory), computational acceleration (quantum-like speedup), and topological access levels.
	•	Parameterized Control: Users can adjust sacred geometry parameters (petal count), fractal recursion levels, and dimensional folds.
	•	Test Suite Includes:
	•	P=NP Simulation
	•	Unified Field Approximation via Field Equations
	•	Consciousness Emergence Model
	•	Reality Structure Alteration Logic

Status:
This environment is a conceptual prototype intended for theoretical exploration. It does not perform real computation on input problems but models and visualizes the potential of a fractal-geometric computing architecture.

Intended Audience:
Researchers in unconventional computation, AI emergence, quantum simulation, complexity theory, or those exploring biologically-inspired or geometrically-rooted architectures for future computing systems.
