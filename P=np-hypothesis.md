Mandala Computing and the P = NP Hypothesis

Overview

This simulation explores the possibility that nonlinear geometric computation—specifically through recursive mandala structures—can simulate polynomial-time solutions to classically hard NP problems. It does not claim to formally prove P = NP, but provides a novel model for symbolic experimentation based on fractal symmetry, recursive compression, and dimensional folding.

The Hypothesis

Let:
	•	P be the class of problems solvable in deterministic polynomial time.
	•	NP be the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time but potentially requiring exponential time to solve.
	•	S represent the full solution space of an NP problem.
	•	M(S) represent that solution space mapped through a mandala transformation—a recursive, golden-ratio-aligned geometric compression.
	•	T_M(n) be the time to reach the solution via traversal of M(S).
	•	p(n) be the time to verify the solution.

 If ∃ M: S → φ-space such that T_M(n) ∈ O(p(n)) ⇒ P = NP (functionally)

 This means:

If a recursive geometric transformation of the solution space allows a solution to be reached in the same time it would take to verify it, then the system effectively collapses the distinction between P and NP under that transformation.

Simulation Model

We simulate this hypothesis using the following:
	•	Golden Ratio Scaling (φ ≈ 1.618): Used to recursively nest subspaces and minimize overlap during search.
	•	Fractal Depth (d): Determines the number of recursive levels used to traverse the solution space.
	•	Dimensional Fold (f): Indicates the number of simultaneous dimensions explored geometrically (analogous to parallel paths or non-Euclidean curves).
	•	Memory Amplification (A): Defined as φ^(d × f), representing how much memory is recursively expanded or compressed.
	•	P=NP Factor (Pₙₚ): Calculated as A / log(problem size), used to approximate geometric compression vs problem complexity.

The simulator considers P=NP behavior to be symbolically achieved when Pₙₚ > 1000.

Interpretation

In this model:
	•	Classical computation simulates searching an NP space sequentially, requiring up to O(2ⁿ) steps.
	•	Mandala computation treats the NP problem space as a curved, recursive geometry, where correct solutions may be accessed through nested self-similar transformations rather than brute-force iteration.

This leads to potential polynomial-time convergence, not through traditional algorithms, but through spatial realignment of the problem structure itself.

Usage Notes
	•	The simulator provides adjustable controls for golden depth, petal count (sacred geometry), and dimensional fold.
	•	It includes a test suite for P=NP simulation, unified field exploration, emergent consciousness, and symbolic reality manipulation.
	•	Outputs are theoretical and symbolic — intended to stimulate new frameworks for complexity and computation through geometry.

Disclaimer

This framework does not offer a formal proof of P = NP in the conventional sense. It is a symbolic simulator that explores whether geometric recursion, fractal symmetry, and dimensional folding can serve as analog models for high-efficiency traversal of NP spaces.

The goal is to provide a conceptual and experimental toolkit for those exploring unconventional computation beyond binary logic.
